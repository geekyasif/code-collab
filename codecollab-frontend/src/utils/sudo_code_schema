if {
	i want to add the question in the group and no any group is created by me
	then i have to create a new group and add members into it
}
else{
	i am in any group so check in which group i am admin or not 
	if i am admin then i can add the questions
	else i cannot add the question to it
}



Addding member in the Group
	fetch the group that is created by me
	add the member with username/email and by default the isAdmin is false later we can change the isAdmin if we want to create the admin so he can add the member too
